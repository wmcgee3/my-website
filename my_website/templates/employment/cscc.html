<p>With the recommendation of two of my instructors, I was hired as a Peer Tutor for Computer Science courses at
    Columbus State Community College. I tutored introductory Computer Science courses and it was extremely rewarding to
    help fellow students understand programming.</p>
<p>I continued tutoring a few Computer Science students after graduating from Columbus State and I am hoping
    to pursue a bachelor's and then master's degree so I can moonlight as an adjunct instructor for Computer Science
    courses.</p>
