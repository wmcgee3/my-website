<p class="bigger">After serving as a medic in the U.S. Army for four years, William volunteered to change his job and become an
    intelligence analyst. Part of the training for his new job was language school. He was assigned the language of
    Pashto and was sent to the Defense Language Institute - Foreign language Center at the Presidio of Monterey in
    California. The Pashto program was 16 months of language, culture, and history training. Upon completion
    of the program, William was awarded a diploma with honors.</p>
