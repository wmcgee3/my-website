<p class="bigger">William McGee began studying at CSCC in January of 2019 pursuing an Associate's of Applied Science in Cybersecurity.
    After two semesters of studying Cybersecurity, William decided to change his major and pursue the Software Developer
    Associate's of Applied Science. Fortunately, most of the classes that he completed in his first two semesters
    counted towards his new major of study. He graduated Magna Cum Laude in December of 2020.</p>
